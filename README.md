# Admin Menu Source

This integrates with the standard Admin Bar where you can specify which menu
items should be shown for each role.

The role must have *access administration bar* permission.

## Requirements:
No dependencies

## Installation:
Install this module using the official Backdrop CMS instructions at https://docs.backdropcms.org/documentation/extend-with-modules

Visit the configuration page under /admin/config/administration/admin_bar/source

## Documentation:
This module is a fork of: -
 http://drupal.org/project/admin_menu_source Version 7.x-1.1+13-dev

1. Use an existing menu or create a new menu for a Role.
2. Go to the admin page and select the menu and change role.
3. Save and clear caches.

Note: When creating menus, the top-level menu item is ignored, this is due to
the Admin Bar in core being hard wired. See the admin page for this module
for examples.
